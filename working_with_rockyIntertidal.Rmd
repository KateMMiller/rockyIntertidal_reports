## rockyIntertidal R package demo {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Getting started {.tabset}

#### Installation
<h4><b>Step 1.</b> Install R, RStudio, and RTools in Software Center</h4>
<h4><b>Step 2.</b> Install devtools package in R:</h4>
```{r, eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
install.packages('devtools')
```
<h4><b>Step 3.</b> Install rockyIntertidal from github</h4>
Note that whenever the `rockyIntertidal`` package is updated, you can rerun this code to install the latest version.
```{r, eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
library(devtools)
install_github("KateMMiller/rockyIntertidal")
```
<h4><b>Step 4.</b> Load rockyIntertidal R package</h4>
```{r, class.source = "indent"}
library(rockyIntertidal)
```
<h4><b>Step 5.</b> Import data</h4>
Note that R is not able to connect to files on Sharepoint or MS Teams (b/c Teams also stores all files on Sharepoint). That means you need to store data package files on your local machine or on a server (e.g. NETN Z drive). The default option for importing data will add the data package views (i.e., flatfiles) to an environment called ROCKY to your Environment work space (i.e. Environment tab in top right panel). If you would rather import each individual view into your R session, specify with the new_env argument (e.g., `importData(new_env = F)`). To import data using the default settings (i.e. run `importData()` with no arguments), you must have the rocky intertidal front end set as a User DSN called rocky_FE. The database front end must also be linked with the latest rocky intertidal backend to pull in the latest data.  
```{r echo = F, results = 'hide', include = F}
importData()
```
<p class = 'indent'>
<span style='color:#1942B5;'><b>Option 1.</b> Import data via .csv files. The file path should be where csvs are on your machine or server.</span></p>
```{r, eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
importData(type = 'csv',
           filepath = "C:/NETN/R_Dev/data") # update filepath to your computer
```
<p class = 'indent'>
<span style='color:#1942B5;'><b>Option 2.</b> Import data via zip file of csvs. The filepath should be the location and name of the zip file.</span></p>
```{r eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
importData(type = 'zip',
           filepath = "C:/NETN/R_Dev/data/NETN_RockyIntertidal_Data_Package_20240927.zip")
```
<p class = 'indent'>
<span style='color:#1942B5;'><b>Option 3.</b> Import data via data package database file on your computer</span></p>
```{r eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
importData(type = 'dbfile',
           filepath = "C:/NETN/R_Dev/data/NETN_RockyIntertidal_Database_fe_20240919.accdb")
```
<p class = 'indent'>
<span style='color:#1942B5;'><b>Option 4.</b> Import data via data package database DSN (Data Source Name) on your computer. </span>
Note that this is the default setting. As long as you have a named DSN called "rocky_FE" that links to the data package database, and that database links to the latest rocky intertidal backend database, the code below will run. See <i>Setting up DSN</i> tab for how to set up DSN.</p>
```{r eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
importData() # easiest
importData(type = 'DSN', odbc = "rocky_FE") # equivalent to line above
```
<h4><b>Step 6.</b> (Optional) Export data package to zip </h4>
You can export all of the csvs to a zip file with the day's date stamped on the file name. This allows you to import the tables from the database, then export the csvs as one zip file.
```{r eval = F, class.source = "indent"}
exportData(filepath = "./data", zip = TRUE) 
```

```{r eval = F, echo = F, class.source = "indent"}
exportData(filepath = "../data", zip = TRUE) 
```

<h4><b>Step 7. Play with the data</b></h4>
The functions in the `rockyIntertidal`` package are designed to work with the views, and are the best way to interact with the data to query by park, site, year, species, etc. However, if you want to view the raw data, and you imported the data into the ROCKY environment, you can access them with the code below:
```{r eval = F}
# See list of the views
names(ROCKY)

# See top 6 records 
head(ROCKY$Echinoderm_Counts)

# Check structure of view
str(ROCKY$Echinoderm_Counts)

# Look at the whole view
View(ROCKY$Bolts)

# Assign a view to a data frame named chem in R. Interact with sppcov the way you would work with any normal data frame in R. 
sppcov <- ROCKY$PhotoQuadrats_Cover

```

#### Getting help
<h4><b>Getting (and improving) help</b></h4>
The functions in `rockyIntertidal`` have help documentation like any R package. To view the help, you can go to the Packages tab and click on rockyIntertidal (see below). That will show you all the functions in the package. Clicking on individual functions will take you to the help documentation for that function. 
```{r echo = F, out.width = 500, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/NETN/R_Dev/rockyIntertidal/testing_scripts/finding_R_package.jpg")
```

<p class = 'fxn'>You can also see the help of a function by running, for example: </p>
```{r, class.source = 'indent', eval = F}
?importData
```

<p class = 'fxn'>If `rockyIntertidal` isn't loaded yet, you'd run: </p>
```{r, class.source = 'indent', eval = F}
?rockyIntertidal::importData
```

Each function's help includes a Description, Usage (i.e. function arguments and their defaults), Argument options/definitions, and several examples showing how the function can be used. 

<b><span style='color:red;'>This is where you come in! If you notice typos or can think of better descriptions, examples, error messages, etc., please send them my way!</b></span> After we're more comfortable with R packages and get versed on GitHub, you'll be able to make those changes directly in the package. For now, you can just send me your suggestions and I'll make the changes.

Finally, if you ever want to peak under the hood at the function, you can view it several ways. 
<ol>
<li>Keep F2 key pressed and click on the function name in R. This trick works for many but not all functions in R.</li>
<li>View code in the <a href="https://github.com/KateMMiller/rockyIntertidal/tree/main">GitHub katemmiller/rockyIntertidal repo</a>. The functions are in the R folder. 

#### Setting up DSN
<h4><b>Setting up a DSN</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to Windows Start Menu and search ODBC. Click on ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) </li>

```{r echo = F, out.height = '457px', out.width = '564px', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/NETN/R_Dev/Water/waterNETN/testing_scripts/ODBC_step_1.jpg")
```
<br>
<li>Click on <i>Add</i>, then select <i>Microsoft Access Driver (\*.mdb, \*.accdb)</i> then click <i>Finish</i> in next menu.</li>

```{r echo = F, out.height = '450px', out.width = '1018px', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/NETN/R_Dev/Water/waterNETN/testing_scripts/ODBC_step_2.jpg")
```
<br>
<li>Enter <b>rocky_FE</b> into the Data Source Name (red arrow), click on Select (red circle). In new window, click on C:/ (orange arrow) and find the path to your database. If it's on the Z drive, then click on the Drives window and select correct Drive. Click on the data package database (yellow arrow). When complete, click OK. Finally, add the name of the database file to the Description (blue arrow), so it's easier to check whether you're using the latest version.  </li>
```{r echo = F, out.height = '486px', out.width = '600px', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/NETN/R_Dev/Water/waterNETN/testing_scripts/ODBC_step_3.jpg")
```

<li>If updating an existing DSN, follow similar process, except click on the DSN in the first window and select <i>Configure</i> instead of Add.</li>
</ol>

### Get data
<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Access manually</h3></summary>
You can manually access the data in the ROCKY environment via the code below.

<h3>List of dataset names in ROCKY </h3>
```{r}
ls(ROCKY)
names(ROCKY)
```

<h3>Access dataset within ROCKY </h3>
```{r}
head(ROCKY$PointIntercept_SppDetections)
```

However, the better approach is to use the getter functions within the R package, which access the same files, but also allow you to query data based on park, location, years, plot name, species, etc. Those are demonstrated below with various arguments. 

Note also that every function in the package also has a help file that can be accessed via `?getPhotoCover`. Each help file lays out the arguments you can specify and includes examples. <b>Please send me any typos or errors you find, and any suggestions on how to make the function descriptions easier to understand.</b>
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Bolt data </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getBolts(location = "CALISL", plotType = "Photoplot"))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Point Intercept Data </h3></summary>
These are the transect point intercept distances before elevation is determined. Elevation is calculated in `sumPISpecies()`
```{r}
head(getPIBoltDistance()) # PointIntercept_BoltDist_C
head(getPISpecies(location = c("BASHAR", "OTTPOI"))) # PointIntercept_SppDetections
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>PhotoPlot Cover </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getPhotoCover(location = c("BASHAR", "OTTPOI"), target_species = "Barnacle"))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Motile Invert Counts</h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getMotileInvertCounts(park = "ACAD", years = 2013:2021, species = c("LITLIT", "LITOBT", "LITSAX")))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Motile Invert Meas</h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getMotileInvertMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019))
```
</details>


<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Echinoderm Counts </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getEchinoCounts(park = "ACAD", years = 2013:2021, species = "STRDRO"))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Echinoderm Meas </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(getEchinoMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019))
```
</details>

### Summarize Data
For every get function, there's a sum function that summarizes the data. This is typically at the location level for a given species and year. For example, averaging across the 3 point intercept transects, or averaging percent cover across the 5 barnacle photoplots. Summary functions are demonstrated below. 

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Point Intercept Data </h3></summary>
This the function where elevation is calculated for point intercept distances along the transects.
```{r}
head(sumPISpecies(location = c("BASHAR", "OTTPOI"))) 
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>PhotoPlot Cover </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(sumPhotoCover(location = c("BASHAR", "OTTPOI"), target_species = c("Ascophyllum", "Barnacle")))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Motile Invert Counts</h3></summary>
```{r}
head(sumMotileInvertCounts(park = "ACAD", years = 2013:2021, species = c("CARMAE", "HEMISAN")))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Motile Invert Meas</h3></summary>
Measurements are summarized into 5mm bins.
```{r}
head(sumMotileInvertMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Echinoderm Counts </h3></summary>
```{r}
head(sumEchinoCounts(park = "ACAD", years = 2013:2021, species = "STRDRO"))
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Echinoderm Meas </h3></summary>
Measurements are summarized into 5mm bins.
```{r}
head(sumEchinoMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019))
```
</details>

### Plot Data
For most getter and summary functions, there are plotting functions with the same suffix. Examples are below. 

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Species Contours </h3></summary>
These plots combine the point intercept data (dots and symbols on the graph) and the photoplot cover data (pie charts) to compare changes across years.
```{r fig.height = 12, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotSpeciesContours(location = "BASHAR", years = 2013:2018)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Point Intercept Transect </h3></summary>
Plot the transect contours faceted on transect number
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotPITransects(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Point Intercept Species </h3></summary>
Plot point intercept species detections summarized as median and middle 50% distribution of elevation. There are a lot of arguments to produce different plots and figures. Some of the ones I find most useful are below. Note when years aren't specified, all years are included by default.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPISpecies(location = "BASHAR", facet = T, main_groups = T, plotly = T)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPISpecies(park = "BOHA", facet = T, main_groups = T)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPISpecies(location = "SHIHAR", rev_axis = T, facet = T)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPISpecies(location = "OTTPOI", species = c("FUCSPP", "ASCNOD"), plotly = T)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>PhotoPlot Cover </h3></summary>
Plots the photoplot cover summarized as median cover and middle 50% distribution of cover across the photoplots within a target species. Note that there are a lot of arguments that produce different plots and figures (all explained in the help). Here are a few I tend to use the most.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPhotoCover(park = "ACAD", target_species = "Barnacle", plotly = T)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPhotoCover(location = "LITHUN", main_groups = T) 
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPhotoCover(location = "LITHUN", top_spp = 3)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
plotPhotoCover(location = "LITHUN", top_spp = 3, plotly = T, xlab = NULL, plot_title = "Little Hunter")
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPhotoCover(location = "LITHUN", main_groups = T, target_species = "Fucus", plotly = T)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotPhotoCover(location = "BASHAR", main_groups = T, heatmap = TRUE)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Motile Inverts</h3></summary>
Plot the Counts
```{r fig.height = 10, fig.width = 12, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotMotileInvertCounts(location = "OUTBRE", years = 2013:2021)
```

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotMotileInvertCounts(location = "OUTBRE", years = 2013:2021, plotly = T)
```

Plot the measurements
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotMotileInvertMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Echinoderms </h3></summary>
Plot the Counts
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotEchinoCounts(location = "OUTBRE", years = 2013:2021)
```

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotEchinoCounts(location = "OUTBRE", years = 2013:2021, plotly = T)
```


Plot the measurements
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotEchinoMeas(location = "SHIHAR", years = 2013:2019)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Water temp </h3></summary>
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
plotWaterTemp(park = "ACAD", years = 2022, facet_col = 1)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotWaterTemp(location = "BASHAR", years = 2011:2022)
```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Buoy Data </h3></summary>
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotBuoyData(park = "ACAD", metric = 'all')
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
plotBuoyData(park = "ACAD", metric = "temp", year = 2022)

```
</details>

<details open><summary class = 'drop'><h3>Rocky ggplot theme</h3></summary>
The default ggplot aesthetics are too busy, and require several lines of code to turn off. For every package, I create a theme that turns those off and can just be run with the ggplot code. For this package use `theme_rocky()` as shown below.
```{r}
dat <- sumPhotoCover(location = "SHIHAR", target_species = "Ascophyllum", species = "ASCNOD")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = Year, y = median_cover)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_rocky()
```


```{r eval = F, include = F, echo = F}
devtools::reload(pkgload::inst('rockyIntertidal'))
```
